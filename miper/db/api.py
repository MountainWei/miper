"""Defines interface for DB access.

Functions in this module are imported into the miper.db namespace. Call these
functions from miper.db namespace, not the miper.db.api namespace.

All functions in this module return objects that implement a dictionary-like
interface. Currently, many of these objects are sqlalchemy objects that
implement a dictionary interface. However, a future goal is to have all of
these objects be simple dictionaries.
